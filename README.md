## TeraHeap: Reducing Memory Pressure in Managed Big Data Frameworks

### Description

TeraHeap extends the managed runtime (JVM) to use a second,
high-capacity heap over a fast storage device that coexists with the
regular heap. TeraHeap provides direct access to objects on the second
heap (no S/D). It also reduces GC cost by fencing the garbage
collector from scanning the second heap. TeraHeap leverages
frameworks’ property of choosing specific objects for off-heap
placement and offers frameworks a hint-based interface for moving
such objects to the second heap. 

### Install Prerequisites
Install the following packages:
```sh
sudo yum install python3-pip
pip3 install scan-build --user
pip3 install compdb --user
```
OpeJDK1.8 can be compiled with OpenJDK1.8. So, you need first to download
OpenJDK1.8.
```sh
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

# For Centos
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```
Edit the compile.sh script in jdk8u345/ directory by changing the
JAVA_HOME variable to point to the installation directory of openjdk8 as follows:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME="/path/to/openjdk8"
```

The JVM can be compiled only with gcc <= 8.5 and g++ <= 8.5

### Build
1. Build allocator.
```sh
cd allocator
./build.sh
cd -
```
Read the README.md file in allocator directory to export the specific
environment variables

2. Build tera_malloc.
```sh
cd tera_malloc
./build.sh
cd -
```
Read the README.md file in tera_malloc directory to export the
specific environment variables

3. Set your gcc/g++ path/alias 
```sh
cd ./jdk8u345 # for building java8
cd ./jdk17u067 # for building java17
```
and set CC and CXX variables inside compile.sh to your gcc path/alias

4. Build JVM (release mode)
```sh
./compile.sh -r
cd -
```

or

Build JVM (fastdebug mode)
```sh
./compile.sh -d
cd -
```

## Benchmarks
To run benchmarks please clone the repository
[tera_applications](https://github.com/jackkolokasis/tera_applications)
and read the README.md files in each application directory. There are
instructions about how to compile and run the different applications.
